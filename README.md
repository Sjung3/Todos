# TODOS 
Exam project in Java backend course @Teknikhögskolan. 
Created April 2020.

## Criterias for exam
Build a backend to a frontend that I had built in a previous course. 

## Functionalities
An app to be used as a todo list.

## Technologies
Java 13<br>
Spring 2.2.5<br>
Maven<br>
Tomcat<br>
MySQL<br>
JavaScript

## Status
Backend -in progress  
Need to add try/catch or @Security to handle exceptions.

Frontend -in progress  
Improve the code, needs to be leaner.

## Sources
The backend of the app is built through reading chapter three of the book “Building applications with Spring 5 and Vue.js 2” by James J. Ye, Packt. 

The frontend is inspired by the www.todoMVC.com layout and functions.

## Information aimed at my teacher Klas Jönsson.

IDE used for this project is IntelliJ. That is the IDE I used the most. Continued using it for convenience since I know what feature to use, short keyboard short cuts, where to find properties, setting etc. and more. 

Reason for choosing Hibernate to connect with the database is since it seems to be the leanest way to do it. JDBC defiantly requires more code, Spring JDBC gives an impression that it too requires more code. I haven’t done a deep dive to learn about Spring JDBC so might be wrong here though.

My frontend was already built in JavaScript therefor I kept it in JavaScript but adapted it so it would connect to the backend.

I choose to build the project without any testing since I need a bit more practice on this. We didn’t touch the subject about exception handling in backend much during the course, i.e. should the exception message be in a log or should it be visible in the UI, should it be try/catch or @Security annotation, what is best practice etc. Therefore it is now on my ‘To read more about’-list.

There are no commits made during the work of the project. I started the project before I found out we had to use git and that the commits was part of the project. Git was something else that I needed more knowledge of before I got started. I was to eager though to get the project done before I stopped and learned how to use Git.
